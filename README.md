# Nutanix PHP API Lab v2 - Complete Demo

**This lab is now deprecated; All users are strongly encouraged to use the [PHP 7.4 and Laravel 8 demo app](https://github.com/nutanixdev/php-api-lab-devmktg-v3-demo), instead.**

This Laravel 6 demo app is designed as a complete working version of the dashboard created in the [Nutanix PHP and Laravel 6 lab](https://www.nutanix.dev/labs/php-7-laravel-6-api-lab/).

Rather than download this complete app and run it standalone, new users are recommended to follow the lab so that all components and concepts are appropriately communicated.

Those with Laravel experience are welcome to download this demo and use as they see fit, of course.
